I was not able to run my code before uploading to our lms website
because I'd written function main with capital letter.
(In this repository this bug is fixed.)
For this reason I cannot be sure my solution is semantically correct.
Compiler found no syntax error.

Actually, I'm using Mars Eclipse with a linked mode:
My repository of source files is separated from the project folder
and my project folder contains only links to the files.
Perhaps I should consider putting my project folder directly under git.
But who the hell wants to struggle with .gitignore?

Anyway, I feel I am 10 times faster in Java than Python.
