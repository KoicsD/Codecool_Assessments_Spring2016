# Welcome to my Codecool assesment tasks of Spring 2016!

This repository is the "continuing" of [*CodeCool_Assessments_Fall2015*](https://github.com/KoicsD/CodeCool_Assessments_Fall2015).

It is intended to contain the [*CodeCool*](https://www.codecool.com/)-assesment tasks I will solve and I've solved during the Spring of 2016.
On each assesment of this repository we have [*MySQL*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL) task, and there is going to be [*Java*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) as well.
After some months Java may be changed to [*C#*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)).

Each assesment has its own directory with its own *description.md* and *conclusion.md*.

Thank you for following my work! :)
